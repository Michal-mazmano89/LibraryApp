#LibraryApp
My first app based on course "Java od zera" by Paweł Ćwik.
I added some modifications to get better understanding of used mechanisms and also created git/github repository for practice.
Modified version contains:
- auto-incrementing authorID,
- loop/another try when user puts wrong input or tries to add already existing author,
- some minor changes like changing user input to upper-case if needed.

Not many future developement plans due to poor market needs for 20th-century-like application :(
